I am a Master of Computer Science student at the [University of St.Gallen (HSG)](https://www.unisg.ch/en/). I also hold a Master of Banking and Finance degree from the University of St.Gallen and a Bachelor of Echonomics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn). 
<!-- In 2020, motivated by numerous instances where life seemed to be dictated by external forces, I decided to shift my career path towards my true passion in programming, transitioning from Finance to Computer Science. -->

My interest is in **Machine Learning**, especially in **Computer Vision**. Currenlty I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer intern at [WIPO](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html), and I am conducting my master's thesis in Active Learning in Remote Sensing at the [AIML lab](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-aiml-borth/) at the University of St.Gallen.

Now I am living in Switzerland. On my freedays I like skiing and watching football games.
