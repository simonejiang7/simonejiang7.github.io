Hi! :wave:

I’m a Machine Learning Engineer based in Geneva, Switzerland. Before moving here, I studied [computer science](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/programme/master/mcs/) at the [University of St. Gallen (HSG)](https://www.unisg.ch/en/?chash=4f06c9d72f4e61627fdcc5005dd584e2&opendocument=&page=8&cHash=47226fa4fd2e6dba48330163fec5c7cb). I also hold a [Master’s degree in Banking and Finance](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/programme/master/banking-and-finance-mbf/) from the University of St. Gallen and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from [Peking University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/peking-university/about/).

I like to combine the certainty of software engineering with the uncertainty of machine learning. I enjoy building clear, well-structured processes, but the unexpected results from experiments keep me excited as well! I'm currently working on computer vision, with a focus on multi-view image search, while also exploring other state-of-the-art technologies in the industry.

I used to play volleyball and football. These days, I spend most of my free time skiing and exploring the nearby area, which has been a great way to recharge.
